Simplest Web Crawler can be done easily by using two python libraries:
*	{% blockquote BeautifulSoup {% endblockquote %}
*	{% blockquote Requests {% endblockquote %}
you first need to install both of them by:
{% include_code [install Library] [lang:python] /home/batch12-14-6/octopress/source/_posts/install.txt %}
then the simple code to fetch all text of any website is:
{% include_code [code] [lang:python] /home/batch12-14-6/crawler.py %}
